# Introduction
My simple voxel world game motivated by Minecraft.
- It supports real-time online connection with other users (but a bit slow).
- It supports VR-like view changing based on Android acceleration sensor.
- The terrain was created with Perlin noise.
- You can create a new block or destroy it.
- All of these are purely based on Java and OpenGL ES. (In other words, I never used game engines like Unity, Unreal and anything else.)
